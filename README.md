YAY2
====

YAY2 is Yet Another Yarm, the second inception.

It is intended as an easy but flexible streaming solution, intended
for embedded devices. This saves space and noise in the studio.

A web interface allows users to log-on and perform duties. A basic
role-based authorization scheme is envisioned to seperate access
to stream server credentials.

A jingle play-out system either streams to line out or directly 
into the stream, or both.

Audio capturing can be set up on an internal audio device or any
usb audio device supported by Linux.
